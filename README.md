# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Alert Investigation - SOC Analyst Simulation

This repository showcases a simulated phishing alert investigation performed in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. The goal of this project is to demonstrate threat detection, analysis, and incident response skills.

## üìÑ Overview

A suspicious URL was detected within network traffic logs and flagged for investigation. This project documents the steps taken to analyze, verify, and respond to the potential phishing threat.

## üîç Investigation Steps

1. **Log Review**
   - Extracted source and destination IPs, timestamp, and user identity.
   - Identified that the request was not blocked by firewall/EDR initially.

2. **Threat Intelligence Lookup**
   - Analyzed URL using:
     - [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
     - [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/)
     - [AnyRun](https://any.run/)
     - [URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io/)
   - Confirmed domain was malicious (Threat Score: 100/100).

3. **Endpoint Containment**
   - EDR automatically isolated the affected endpoint.
   - Verified no further outbound connections to malicious IPs.

4. **User Awareness**
   - Notified the user and provided phishing awareness reinforcement.

5. **IOC Blocking**
   - Blocked malicious domain and associated IPs across the network.
